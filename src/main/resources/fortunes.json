The starter motor\nrequires large quantities of smoke to operate properly, and that’s why the wire\ngoing to it is so large.\n  Feeling very smug, I continued to expand my hypothesis.  Why are Lucas\nelectronics more likely to leak than say Bosch?  Hmmm...  Aha!!!  Lucas is\nBritish, and all things British leak!  British convertible tops leak water,\nBritish engines leak oil, British displacer units leak hydrostatic fluid, and\nI might add British tires leak air, and the British defense unit leaks\nsecrets... so naturally British electronics leak smoke.", "author":"Jack Banton, PCC Automotive Electrical School"},

Well we left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 31.\nWe were 15 days on the water, and 3 on the boat when we finally arrived in\nAfrica.  Upon our arrival we immediately set up a rigorous schedule:  Up at\n6:00, breakfast, and back in bed by 7:00.  Pretty soon we were back in bed by\n6:30.  Now Africa is full of big game.  The first day I shot two bucks.  That\nwas the biggest game we had.  Africa is primarily inhabited by Elks, Moose\nand Knights of Pithiests.\n  The elks live up in the mountains and come down once a year for their\nannual conventions.  And you should see them gathered around the water hole,\nwhich they leave immediately when they discover it’s full of water.  They\nweren’t looking for a water hole.  They were looking for an alck hole.\n  One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas, how he got in my\npajamas, I don’t know.  Then we tried to remove the tusks.  That’s a tough\nword to say, tusks.  As I said we tried to remove the tusks, but they were\nimbedded so firmly we couldn’t get them out.

The best way\nto avoid broken circuits is to change your fuses regularly.\n  Another common problem is that the lights flicker.  This sometimes\nmeans that your electrical system is inadequate, but more often it means\nthat your home is possessed by demons, in which case you’ll need to get a\ncaulking gun and some caulking.  If you’re not sure whether your house is\npossessed, see “The Amityville Horror”, a fine documentary film based on an\nactual book.  Or call in a licensed electrician, who is trained to spot the\nsigns of demonic possession, such as blood coming down the stairs, enormous\ncats on the dinette table, etc.", "author":"Dave Barry, “The Taming of the Screw”"},

{"quote":"... So the documentary-makers stick with sharks.  Generally, their\nprocedure is to scatter bleeding fish pieces around their boat, so as\nto infest the waters.  I would estimate that the primary food source of\nsharks today is bleeding fish pieces scattered by people making\ndocumentaries.  Once the sharks arrive, they are generally fairly\nlistless.  The general shark attitude seems to be: “Oh God, another\ndocumentary.”  So the divers have to somehow goad them into attacking,\nunder the guise of Scientific Research.  “We know very little about the\neffect of electricity on sharks,” the narrator will say, in a deeply\nscientific voice.  “That is why Todd is going to jab this Great White\nin the testicles with a cattle prod.”  The divers keep this kind of\nthing up until the shark finally gets irritated and snaps at them, and\nthen they act as though this was a totally unexpected and very\ndangerous development, although clearly it is what they wanted all along.", "author":"Dave Barry, “The Wonders of Sharks on TV”"},
{"quote":"***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)\n\nIt has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge\nin order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not\nsufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly,\nwe have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call\n“wisdom engineering”.  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a\nwisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.\nIMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom\nabout such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so\nforth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic\nrules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL\nsucceeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed\nin western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those\nunderlying Plato’s theory of government, Kant’s metaphysics, Nietzsche’s theory\nof value, and Husserl’s phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe\nIMMANUEL’s achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly\ndiscuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration."},

{"quote":"A sharper perspective on this matter is particularly important to feminist\nthought today, because a major tendency in feminism has constructed the\nproblem of domination as a drama of female vulnerability victimized by male\naggression.  Even the more sophisticated feminist thinkers frequently shy\naway from the analysis of submission, for fear that in admitting woman’s\nparticipation in the relationship of domination, the onus of responsibility\nwill appear to shift from men to women, and the moral victory from women to\nmen.  More generally, this has been a weakness of radical politics: to\nidealize the oppressed, as if their politics and culture were untouched by\nthe system of domination, as if people did not participate in their own\nsubmission.  To reduce domination to a simple relation of doer and done-to\nis to substitute moral outrage for analysis.", "author":"Jessica Benjamin, “The Bonds of Love”"},

An imbedded system can’t permanently trust anything\nit hears from the outside world.  It must sniff around, adapt, consider, sniff\naround, and adapt again.  I’m not talking about ordinary modular programming\ncarefulness here.  No.  Programming an imbedded system calls for undiluted\nraging maniacal paranoia.  For example, our ethernet front ends need to know\nwhat network number they are on so that they can address and route PUPs\nproperly.  How do you find out what your network number is?  Easy, you ask a\ngateway.  Gateways are required by definition to know their correct network\nnumbers.  Once you’ve got your network number, you start using it and before\nyou can blink you’ve got it wired into fifteen different sockets spread all\nover creation.  Now what happens when the panic-stricken operator realizes he\nwas running the wrong version of the gateway which was giving out the wrong\nnetwork number?  Never supposed to happen.  Tough.  Supposing that your\nsoftware discovers that the gateway is now giving out a different network\nnumber than before, what’s it supposed to do about it?  This is not discussed\nin the protocol document.  Never supposed to happen.  Tough.  I think you\nget my drift."},

Pull one of these\n  horses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all\n  of these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you\n  took out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k\n  horses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses\n  are all the same color.  We have k true => k+1 true; therefore all\n  horses are the same color.\nTheorem: All horses have an infinite number of legs.\nProof (by intimidation):\n  Everyone would agree that all horses have an even number of legs.  It\n  is also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in\n  back.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a\n  horse to have!  Now the only number that is both even and odd is\n  infinity; therefore all horses have an infinite number of legs.\n  However, suppose that there is a horse somewhere that does not have an\n  infinite number of legs.

The following story is told about him: when they\nmoved from Cambridge to Newton his wife, knowing that he would be absolutely\nuseless on the move, packed him off to MIT while she directed the move.  Since\nshe was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had\nmoved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to\nhim.  Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.  He\nreached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled\nsome notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and\nthrew the piece of paper away.  At the end of the day he went home (to the\nold address in Cambridge, of course).  When he got there he realized that they\nhad moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of\npaper with the address was long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There\nwas a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where\nhe had moved to, saying, “Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I’m Norbert Weiner\nand we’ve just moved.  Would you know where we’ve moved to?”  To which the\nyoung girl replied, “Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget.”\n  The capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the\nstory) about the truth of the story, many years later.

{"quote":"One promising concept that I came up with right away was that you could\nmanufacture personal air bags, then get a law passed requiring that\nthey be installed on congressmen to keep them from taking trips.  Let’s\nsay your congressman was trying to travel to Paris to do a fact-finding\nstudy on how the French government handles diseases transmitted by\nsherbet.  Just when he got to the plane, his mandatory air bag,\nstrapped around his waist, would inflate -- FWWAAAAAAPPPP -- thus\nrendering him too large to fit through the plane door.  It could also\nbe rigged to inflate whenever the congressman proposed a law.  (“Mr.\nSpeaker, people ask me, why should October be designated as Cuticle\nInspection Month?  And I answer that FWWAAAAAAPPPP.”) This would save\nmillions of dollars, so I have no doubt that the public would violently\nsupport a law requiring airbags on congressmen.

It is fatal in\nconcentrations of as little as 0.000001 p.p.m.  Humans exposed to the\noxygen concentrations die within a few minutes.  Symptoms resemble very\nmuch those of cyanide poisoning (blue face, etc.).  In higher\nconcentrations, e.g. 20%, the toxic effect is somewhat delayed and it\ntakes about 2.5 billion inhalations before death takes place.  The reason\nfor the delay is the difference in the mechanism of the toxic effect of\noxygen in 20% concentration.  It apparently contributes to a complex\nprocess called aging, of which very little is known, except that it is\nalways fatal.\n\nHowever, the main disadvantage of the 20% oxygen concentration is in the\nfact it is habit forming.  The first inhalation (occurring at birth) is\nsufficient to make oxygen addiction permanent.  After that, any\nconsiderable decrease in the daily oxygen doses results in death with\nsymptoms resembling those of cyanide poisoning.\n\nOxygen is an extreme fire hazard.  All of the fires that were reported in\nthe continental U.S. for the period of the past 25 years were found to be\ndue to the presence of this gas in the atmosphere surrounding the buildings\nin question.\n\nOxygen is especially dangerous because it is odorless, colorless and\ntasteless, so that its presence can not be readily detected until it is\ntoo late.", "author":"Chemical & Engineering News February 6, 1956"},

These laws were written down sometime in the\n13th century, but date back even down into Viking times.  The oldest one is\nthe Vastgota law which clearly has pagan influences, thinly covered with some\nChristian stuff.  In this law, we find a page about “lekare”, which is the\nOld Norse word for a performing artist, actor/jester/musician etc.  Here is\nan approximate translation, where I have written “artist” as equivalent of\n“lekare”.\n  “If an artist is beaten, none shall pay fines for it.  If an artist\n  is wounded, one such who goes with hurdie-gurdie or travels with\n  fiddle or drum, then the people shall take a wild heifer and bring\n  it out on the hillside.  Then they shall shave off all hair from the\n  heifer’s tail, and grease the tail.  Then the artist shall be given\n  newly greased shoes.  Then he shall take hold of the heifer’s tail,\n  and a man shall strike it with a sharp whip.  If he can hold her, he\n  shall have the animal.  If he cannot hold her, he shall endure what\n  he received, shame and wounds.”"},

He apparently fell backward by accident on a dozen salad\nforks.  Simultaneously the true heir, his son Carotene, mysteriously\nfled the city, complaining of some sort of plot and a lot of\nthreatening notes left on his breakfast tray.  At the time, this looked\nsuspicious what with his father’s death, and Carotene was suspected of\nfoul play.  Then the rest of the King’s relatives began to drop dead\none after the other in an odd fashion.  Some were found strangled with\ndishrags and some succumbed to food poisoning.  A few were found\ndrowned in the soup vats, and one was attacked by assailants unknown\nand beaten to death with a pot roast.  At least three appear to have\nthrown themselves backward on salad forks, perhaps in a noble gesture\nof grief over the King’s untimely end.  Finally there was no one left\nin Minas Troney who was either eligible or willing to wear the accursed\ncrown, and the rule of Twodor was up for grabs.  The scullery slave\nParrafin bravely accepted the Stewardship of Twodor until that day when\na lineal descendant of Carotene’s returns to reclaim his rightful\nthrone, conquer Twodor’s enemies, and revamp the postal system.", "author":"Harvard Lampoon, “Bored of the Rings”"},

{"quote":"The most recent attempt to revive the moribund campus left, a national\nconference held at Rutgers University February 5-7, ended when the\nparticipants decided that they were too racist to found a new national\norganization.\n  The stated goal of the conference was the formation of a national\norganization that would “give expression to a shared consciousness.”  The\norientation materials declared that this was “a historic moment” -- you\nknow, like Port Huron and the Sixties -- and the Rutgers host committee had\nevery reason to expect their goal would be accomplished.\n  But it was not to be.  Given that this was a conference of *New*\nNew Leftists, reason had nothing to do with it.\n  A revealing article by Vania del Borgo and Maria Margaronis in “The\nNation”, [“Beyond the Fragments,” 3/26/88] says “The defining moment of the\nweekend came when the conference was almost at its end.  On Sunday morning,\na twenty-five-member students of color caucus confronted the assembled body\nwith its overwhelming whiteness...”  Joined by the Gay & Bisexual Caucus, the\nStudents of Color Caucus declared that the founding of such an overwhelmingly\nwhite organization would itself constitute a racist act.  The four hundred or\nso leftist activists were told that they had no right to ratify a constitution\nor elect any officers.  While recognizing “the need to examine the real\npossibilities of a broad-based, racially diverse student movement” and paying\nlip service to the need for “dialogue,” they threatened to walk out if their\ndemands were not met.  As *The Nation* article describes the scene:  “To their\nastonishment, their intervention was greeted with a standing ovation.” Handed\nan ultimatum which demanded that they disband, this would-be successor to the\nradical student movements of the Sixties promptly voted itself out of\nexistence.  As del Borgo and Margaronis put it, “After much chaotic discussion\nand a confused voice vote, the convention suspended all its other work and\nbroke into regional groups to discuss ‘outreach.’”", "author":"Libertarian Agenda, May 1988"},

Alexander Pope called him “wretched Wither” and Dryden said of his\nverse that “if they rhymed and rattled all was well”.\n  In our own time, “The Dictionary of National Biography” notes that his\nwork “is mainly remarkable for its mass, fluidity and flatness.  It usually\nlacks any genuine literary quality and often sinks into imbecile doggerel”.\n  High praise, indeed, and it may tempt you to savour a typically\nrewarding stanza: It is taken from “I loved a lass” and is concerned with\nthe higher emotions.\n    She would me “Honey” call,\n    She’d -- O she’d kiss me too.\n    But now alas!  She’s left me\n    Falero, lero, loo.\n  Among other details of his mistress which he chose to immortalize\nwas her prudent choice of footwear.\n    The fives did fit her shoe.\n  In 1639 the great poet’s life was endangered after his capture by\nthe Royalists during the English Civil War.  When Sir John Denham, the\nRoyalist poet, heard of Wither’s imminent execution, he went to the King and\nbegged that his life be spared.  When asked his reason, Sir John replied,\n“Because that so long as Wither lived, Denham would not be accounted the\nworst poet in England.”", "author":"Stephen Pile, “The Book of Heroic Failures”"},

The light we\nreceive from the Moon is one ten-thousandth of the light we receive from the\nSun, so we can ignore that.  With these data we can compute the temperature\nof Heaven.  The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where\nthe heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation,\ni.e., Heaven loses fifty times as much heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using\nthe Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute\ntemperature of the earth (~300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact\ntemperature of Hell cannot be computed, but it must be less than 444.6C, the\ntemperature at which brimstone or sulphur changes from a liquid to a gas.\nRevelations 21:8 says “But the fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their\npart in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.”  A lake of molten\nbrimstone means that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point,\nor 444.6C  (Above this point it would be a vapor, not a lake.)

{"quote":"The Worst American Poet\n  Julia Moore, “the Sweet Singer of Michigan” (1847-1920) was so bad that\nMark Twain said her first book gave him joy for 20 years.\n  Her verse was mainly concerned with violent death -- the great fire\nof Chicago and the yellow fever epidemic proved natural subjects for her\npen.\n  Whether death was by drowning, by fits or by runaway sleigh, the\nformula was the same:\n    Have you heard of the dreadful fate\n    Of Mr. P.P. Bliss and wife?\n    Of their death I will relate,\n    And also others lost their life\n    (in the) Ashbula Bridge disaster,\n    Where so many people died.\n  Even if you started out reasonably healthy in one of Julia’s poems,\nthe chances are that after a few stanzas you would be at the bottom of a\nriver or struck by lightning.  A critic of the day said she was “worse than\na Gatling gun” and in one slim volume counted 21 killed and 9 wounded.\n  Incredibly, some newspapers were critical of her work, even\nsuggesting that the sweet singer was “semi-literate”.  Her reply was\nforthright: “The Editors that has spoken in this scandalous manner have went\nbeyond reason.”  She added that “literary work is very difficult to do”.", "author":"Stephen Pile, “The Book of Heroic Failures”"},

Enesco agreed to give lessons to the son who was quite\nunhampered by great musical talent.\n  Three years later the boy’s father insisted that he give a public\nconcert.  “His aunt said that nobody plays the violin better than he does.\nA cousin heard him the other day and screamed with enthusiasm.”  Although\nEnesco feared the consequences, he arranged a recital at the Salle Gaveau\nin Paris.  However, nobody bought a ticket since the soloist was unknown.\n  “Then you must accompany him on the piano,” said the boy’s father,\n“and it will be a sell out.”\n  Reluctantly, Enesco agreed and it was.  On the night an excited\naudience gathered.  Before the concert began Enesco became nervous and\nasked for someone to turn his pages.\n  In the audience was Alfred Cortot, the brilliant pianist, who\nvolunteered and made his way to the stage.\n  The soloist was of uniformly low standard and next morning the\nmusic critic of Le Figaro wrote: “There was a strange concert at the Salle\nGaveau last night.

This record is held by Alcoente Prison,\nnear Lisbon in Portugal.\n  During the weeks leading up to the escape in July 1978 the prison\nwarders had noticed that attendances had fallen at film shows which\nincluded “The Great Escape”, and also that 220 knives and a huge quantity\nof electric cable had disappeared.  A guard explained, “Yes, we were\nplanning to look for them, but never got around to it.”  The warders had\nnot, however, noticed the gaping holes in the wall because they were\n“covered with posters”.  Nor did they detect any of the spades, chisels,\nwater hoses and electric drills amassed by the inmates in large quantities.\nThe night before the breakout one guard had noticed that of the 36\nprisoners in his block only 13 were present.  He said this was “normal”\nbecause inmates sometimes missed roll-call or hid, but usually came back\nthe next morning.\n  “We only found out about the escape at 6:30 the next morning when\none of the prisoners told us,” a warder said later.

Later, while\nlooking through a name book for his forthcoming baby, Bill Catchings noticed\nthat “Kermit” was a Celtic word for “free”, which is what all Kermit programs\nshould be, and words to this effect replaced the strained acronyms in our\nsource code (Bill’s baby turned out to be a girl, so he had to name her Becky\ninstead).  When BYTE Magazine was preparing our 1984 Kermit article for\npublication, they suggested we contact Henson Associates Inc. for permission\nto say that we did indeed name the protocol after Kermit the Frog.

They are a very effective method for\ndemonstrating excitement, and can also spice up an otherwise plain-looking\nsentence!  However, there are drawbacks!  Too much unnecessary exclaiming\ncan lead to a reduction in the effect that an exclamation point has on\nthe reader!  For example, the sentence\n\n  Jane went to the store to buy bread\n\nshould only be ended with an exclamation point if there is something\nsensational about her going to the store, for example, if Jane is a\ncocker spaniel or if Jane is on a diet that doesn’t allow bread or if\nJane doesn’t exist for some reason!  See how easy it is?!  Proper control\nof exclamation points can add new meaning to your life!

{"quote":"Well, anyway, I was reading this James Bond book, and right away I realized\nthat like most books, it had too many words.  The plot was the same one that\nall James Bond books have: An evil person tries to blow up the world, but\nJames Bond kills him and his henchmen and makes love to several attractive\nwomen.  There, that’s it: 24 words.  But the guy who wrote the book took\n*thousands* of words to say it.\n  Or consider “The Brothers Karamazov”, by the famous Russian alcoholic\nFyodor Dostoyevsky.  It’s about these two brothers who kill their father.\nOr maybe only one of them kills the father.  It’s impossible to tell because\nwhat they mostly do is talk for nearly a thousand pages.If all Russians talk\nas much as the Karamazovs did, I don’t see how they found time to become a\nmajor world power.\n  I’m told that Dostoyevsky wrote “The Brothers Karamazov” to raise\nthe question of whether there is a God.  So why didn’t he just come right\nout and say: “Is there a God? It sure beats the heck out of me.”\n  Other famous works could easily have been summarized in a few words:\n\n* “Moby Dick” -- Don’t mess around with large whales because they symbolize\n  nature and will kill you.\n* “A Tale of Two Cities” -- French people are crazy.", "author":"Dave Barry"},

{"quote":"YOUR FOAMY FUTURE\n  by Miss Fortune\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18)\n  You have nothing better to think about than what to wear and what\ntype of champagne to take to the neighbors Halloween Party.  Just take beer!\nDon’t try to copy the “Joneses”, pull them up to your level and remember, in\nCalifornia Hoalloween is redundant anyhow.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19 - March 20)\n  Focus on strengthening friendships this Fall.  You find others are\nfascinated by your intelligence, your wit, your drinking ability, and your\nbank account.  Just make sure you realize it’s far more impressive when\nother discover your good qualities without your help."},
{"quote":"YOUR FOAMY FUTURE\n  by Miss Fortune\n\nARIES (March 21 - April 19)\n  Matters are not good, where you health is concerned.  This Fall, be\nsure to “walk groundly, talk profoundly, drink roundly, and sleep soundly”\nand you will live all the days of your life.\n\nTAURUS (April 20 - May 20)\n  You spent a fortune on beer this past summer and now find yourself\nin a deep depression because you can’t afford even one of your favorite\nbrewskis.  Don’t fret too much, Taurus.  To get back on your feet simply\nmiss two car payments.\n\nGEMINI (May 21 - June 21)\n  You think you’re falling in love with a person who has a lot in\ncommon with yourself.  You both prefer ales, you’ve both tried your hand\nat homebrewing, and you both want to visit every new brewpub that opens.\nSounds impressive but remember you really don’t know your partner until\nyou meet in court."},
{"quote":"YOUR FOAMY FUTURE\n  by Miss Fortune\n\nCANCER (Jun 22 - July 22)\n  You’ve been awarded a clean bill of health this month and you feel\nyou owe it all to the excessive amount of Vitamin B, Iron, and Malt you get\nin your beer.  Being healthy is admirable but don’t you think you’re going\nto feel stupid one day lying in a hospital dying of nothing?\n\nLEO (July 23 - August 22)\n  You will soon acquire a large sum of money and will be in seventh\nheaven as you head to the nearest Liquor Barn and buy all the beer they have\nin stock.  Whoever said money couldn’t buy happiness didn’t know where to\nshop.\n\nVIRGO (August 23 - September 22)\n  Your late night, beer drinking, “life in the fast lane” parties are\naffecting your job production the next morning.  You feel a nine to five job\nis not for a “party animal” such as yourself and may feel the need for a\ncareer change.  Just remember, people who work sitting down get paid more\nthan people who work standing up."},
